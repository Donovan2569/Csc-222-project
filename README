Description: This program functions as a basic shell, providing users with a command-line interface to execute shell commands. Execution begins as an infinite loop inside the "main()" function.
             In this loop, the program repeatedly prompts the user for input and processes their commands.

             Upon prompting the user, the "CommandPrompt()" function displays a shell prompt tha includes the current working directory obtained using the "getcwd()" function. The function 
             dynamically allocates memory for storing user input. Once the user inputs a command, it gets passed to the "ParseCommandLine()" function. Here, the input string is analyzed to 
             extract the command and its arguments. This process involves tokenizing the input with the "strtok()" function and storing the tokens in an array. The function then returns a 
             "struct ShellCommand" containing the parsed command and its arguments. 

             With the parsed command and arguments available, the program proceeds to execute the command using the "ExecuteCommand()" function, which creates a child process using the "fork()" 
             function and uses the "execvp()" function to replace the child process's memory with the specified command and its arguments. Meanwhile, the parent process waits for the child process
             to finish execution using the "wait()" function.

             In summary, this program creates a shell that allows users to enter commands which are then parsed, executed, and displayed to the user. The shell prompt updates to reflect changes in
             the current working directory, and the program effectively manages processes to handle user input and execute commands.

Non-implemented functionality: We were unable to fully implement I/O redirection. We were able to get the > redirection working, but not the < redirection. You are able to use cat < FileToAccess,
                               but are unable to do OutputFile < InputFile.
